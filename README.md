# TradingView-Alpaca-alerts
A python program that receives alerts from TradingView (indicators and strategies) and creates buy/sell orders on Alpaca with real and paper accounts.

- Uses TradingView webhook. Can use ngrok, cloud service, etc. to connect webhook to flask server.
- Compatible with **'Machine Learning: Lorentzian Classification'** indicator alerts (match Close Long, Open Long, etc.)
  - <font color=orange>LDC Kernel Bullish â–² | CLSK@4.015 | </font>(1)...
- Also compatible with strategy alerts (ex. strategy.entry, strategy.close_all, etc.)
  - <font color=orange>order sell | MSFT@337.57 | </font>Directional Movement Index...
  -   Add the following to the beginning of a strategy alert for buying/selling order: `{{strategy.order.action}} | {{ticker}}@{{close}} | {{strategy.order.id}}`.
- Stop loss and other similar features should be handled in pine script. 


**Known issues:**
- Going short from long position or vice versa doesn't work. Need to wait for order to zero out position then open an order. 
- Need to see about adding something to fill or kill after x time, especially for limit orders.
